### Introduction

An online portfolio is an representation of work of `Bibha` has to create,
`Bibha` is a passionate web developer learner at HYF Belgium.

`Bibha's` portfolio is exhaustively informative, letting her visitors know
everything and anything that needs to be known, especially about her skills and
how she infuses her inspiration of other learners at HYF. This web dev portfolio
has a blog page containing tech articles.

### Source

In order to perform my analysis, I need to look at the available sources of
portfolio documentation.

Portfolio has [community site](https://github.com/topics/portfolio-website) and
some [README](https://github.com/topics/portfolio-template)

### Approach

My focus is on improving discussion on recent issues, by identifying good
stakeholders. To this end, I first take a look at a number of recent issues in
the hopes of identifying active contributors, and examine the activities her
tend to perform. This should hopefully give me a clearer picture of the her
involved and her roles.

### Conclusion

Through information gathering on `Portfolio` public channels, their
documentation their project history
[issues](https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio/issues) and
[pull request](https://github.com/rammcodes/Dopefolio/pulls) I have been able to
to learn a lot about Portfolio and the people involved. By analyzing all these
insights I have be able to identify a number of individual and groups that I
consider Portfolio stakeholder community.

With this, I believe I have been able to sketch a clear image of the stakeholder
and her concerns, which should provide for a better understanding in discussions
surrounding the project.
