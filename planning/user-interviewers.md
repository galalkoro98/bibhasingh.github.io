## interviews

I decided to arrange a list of fancy questions I've been asked during the
interviews I had. They might be useful for you.

P.S. I don't really value theoretical questions, but most of the web development
learners I've been to so far ask only those. The best questions are:-

- [ ] How can they improve their skills to build a better portfolio.
- [ ] What should your portfolio contain.
- [ ] What should a student portfolio include.

## What should a web developer learner portfolio include

Portfolios can be a physical collection of learner work that includes materials
such as written assignments, journal entries, completed tests, artwork, lab
reports, physical projects (such as dioramas or models), and other material
evidence of learning progress and academic accomplishment, including awards,
honors,

## My vision

taking first step to build portfolio. you see technical interviews as an
opportunity to improve your knowledge of the home page.

## Project

This project will be your first step to deliver the instructions that given to
